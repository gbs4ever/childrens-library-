Welcome to your new app! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to use  your Ruby library  app. We have created a checkout system in addition to just reviewing the books. Additional features will be added on , stay tuned !

## Usage
As we know  reading for children is great as it helps them   with their cognitive development to develop their  language, physical, social, and emotional skills.At a certain age we encourage these young minds to start reading on their own. How can we insure that the books they read and the concepts are  appropriate for that child? As we know children develop at different rates and may be scared or not understand certain concepts.  I developed this app so as a community we could build a resource of books and if they are appropriate (with some comments)
